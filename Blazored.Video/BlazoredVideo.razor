	Media Events don't work in Blazor - I believe because they don't bubble.
	Blazor attaches it's event handlers to the document, and does not register
	these events as they don't bubble up to the document.
	So, this uses onchange and forces the video element to have a 'value' property,
	which it doesn't normally have.
	I then populate the 'value' with a JSON string containing the requested data
	and the event name.

	Sample JSON data for an event:
	{
		"name":"Suspend",
		"data":
		{
			"Autoplay":false,
			"Controls":true,
			"CurrentSrc":"videos/elephants2.mp4",
			"CurrentTime":2.758966
		}
	}
